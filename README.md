# Titanic Survival Analysis
My first Data Analysis project exploring survival patterns on the Titanic using Python.

## Overview
- **Dataset:** Titanic passenger data from Kaggle.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- **Goal:** Analyze how fare, class, and age influenced survival.

## Key Findings
- 1st class passengers had a 63% survival rate vs. 24% for 3rd class.
- Median fare for survivors was ~26 vs. ~10 for non-survivors.
- Age showed little difference (~28 years average).

## Files
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb`: Full Jupyter Notebook with code, plots, and insights.
